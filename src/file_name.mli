(** Basename of a File Path

    A [File_name.t] represents the basename of a file path, i.e., the name of an
    entry in the directory that contains it. It is not to be confused with a
    full path.

    For example, in the file path ["/home/user/documents/file.txt"],
    ["file.txt"] is the file_name.

    A valid file_name cannot contain ['/'] or null characters.

    This module provides functions to convert between strings and file_names,
    validate file_names, and some common file_names. *)
